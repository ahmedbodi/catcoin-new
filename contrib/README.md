Python Tools
---------------------

### [BitRPC](/contrib/bitrpc) ###
Allows for sending of all standard Litecoin commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

### [PyMiner](/contrib/pyminer) ###

This is a 'getwork' CPU mining client for Litecoin. It is pure-python, and therefore very, very slow.  The purpose is to provide a reference implementation of a miner, for study.

### [SpendFrom](/contrib/spendfrom) ###

Use the raw transactions API to send coins received on a particular
address (or addresses).

Repository Tools
---------------------

for Debian-based Linux systems. If you compile litecoind/litecoin-qt yourself, there are some useful files here.
