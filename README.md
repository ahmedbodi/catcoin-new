What is JeanJohnCoin?
----------------

JeanJohnCoin is an experimental digital currency that makes the great Jean John even greater. 
JeanJohnCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority except Jean himself: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. JeanJohnCoin Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the JeanJohnCoin Core software, see [https://jeanjohncoin.org](https://jeanjohncoin.org).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. It is actually probably buggy because Jean John does not care about stability, he cares about profits, and profits involve risks
