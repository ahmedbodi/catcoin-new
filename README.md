What is Infcoin?
----------------

Infcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Infcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Infcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

Also note that this coin is purely based on Scrypt algorithm.
